The **PRIDE PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE)** Archive database is a centralized, standards compliant, public data repository for mass spectrometry proteomics data, including protein and peptide identifications and the corresponding expression values, post-translational modifications and supporting mass spectra evidence (both as raw data and peak list files). PRIDE is a core member in the ProteomeXchange (PX) consortium, which provides a standardized way for submitting mass spectrometry based proteomics data to public-domain repositories. Datasets are submitted to ProteomeXchange via PRIDE and are handled by expert bio-curators. All PRIDE public datasets can also be searched in ProteomeCentral, the portal for all ProteomeXchange datasets.
