Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is a database repository of high throughput gene expression data and hybridization arrays, chips, microarrays.

GEO is an international public repository that archives and freely distributes microarray, next-generation sequencing, and other forms of high-throughput functional genomics data submitted by the research community.

The three main goals of GEO are to:

- Provide a robust, versatile database in which to efficiently store high-throughput functional genomic data

-  Offer simple submission procedures and formats that support complete and well-annotated data deposits from the research community

- Provide user-friendly mechanisms that allow users to query, locate, review and download studies and gene expression profiles of interest
