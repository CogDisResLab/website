Drug discovery is a time intensive and economically costly process. A wealth of information regarding small molecule targets, side effects, gene expression profiles, among several other attributes are publicly available throughout currently existing online tools and repositories. By collecting and analyzing the aggregated information from these resources, novel relationships between currently existing small molecules can be discovered. Understanding the underlying molecular and structural similarities between seemingly heterogeneous small molecules can aid in drug repurposing studies, and potentially the discovery of novel drugs. Furthermore, these data can be leveraged for machine learning case studies that may predict novel uses for already existing drugs. Drugmonizome is a web portal for querying sets of known drugs and computing significant biomedical terms that drugs in the set share.
