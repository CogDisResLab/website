**STRING** is a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations; they stem from computational prediction, from knowledge transfer between organisms, and from interactions aggregated from other (primary) databases.

Data Sources
Interactions in STRING are derived from five main sources:
 

- Genomic Context Predictions	
- High-throughput Lab Experiments	
- (Conserved) Co-Expression	
- Automated Textmining	
- Previous Knowledge in Databases

Coverage:  
The STRING database currently covers *24,584,628* proteins from *5090* organisms.
