**Kinase.com** explores the functions, evolution and diversity of protein kinases, the key controllers of cell behavior. It focuses on the kinome, the full complement of protein kinases in any sequenced genome. This includes the extensive KinBase database, and papers and supporting material for the published kinase work from Sugen and the Salk Institute.



**KinBase** holds information on over 3,000 protein kinase genes found in the genomes of human, and many other sequenced genomes. You may search the database by a variety of different gene names and accessions, or according to the sequence based classification.
