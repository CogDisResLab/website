*P**athway Commons** is an integrated resource of publicly available information about biological pathways including biochemical reactions, assembly of biomolecular complexes, transport and catalysis events and physical interactions involving proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules (e.g. metabolites and drug compounds). Data is collected from multiple providers in standard formats, including the Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX) language and the Proteomics Standards Initiative Molecular Interactions format, and then integrated. Pathway Commons provides biologists with:

- tools to search this comprehensive resource
- a download site offering integrated bulk sets of pathway data (e.g. tables of interactions and gene sets)
- reusable software libraries for working with pathway information in several programming languages (Java, R, Python and Javascript)
- a web service for programmatically querying the entire dataset
