**KinaseMD** integrates 679 374 somatic mutations, 251 522 network-rewiring events, and 390 460 drug response records curated from various sources for 547 kinases. KinaseMD uniquely annotates the mutations and kinase inhibitor response in four types of protein substructures (gatekeeper, A-loop, G-loop and Î±C-helix) that are linked to kinase inhibitor resistance in literature. In addition, KinaseMD annotates functional mutations that may rewire kinase regulatory network and report four phosphorylation signals (gain, loss, up-regulation and down-regulation).
