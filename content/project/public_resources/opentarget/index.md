The **Open Targets Platform** is a comprehensive tool that supports systematic identification and prioritisation of potential therapeutic drug targets.

By integrating publicly available datasets including data generated by the Open Targets consortium, the Platform builds and scores target-disease associations to assist in drug target identification and prioritisation. It also integrates relevant annotation information about targets, diseases, phenotypes, and drugs, as well as their most relevant relationships.
