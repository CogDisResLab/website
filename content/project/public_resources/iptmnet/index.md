**iPTMnet** is a bioinformatics resource for integrated understanding of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) in systems biology context.

It connects multiple disparate bioinformatics tools and systems text mining, data mining, analysis and visualization tools, and databases and ontologies into an integrated cross-cutting research resource to address the knowledge gaps in exploring and discovering PTM networks.


iPTMnet encompasses data from:

- PTM-focused text mining tools, RLIMS-P and eFIP, which extract phosphorylation information from full-scale mining of PubMed abstracts and full-length articles including phosphorylation dependent protein-protein interactions (PPIs)

- A set of curated databases with experimentally observed PTMs

- Biomuta to include variants affecting PTM sites to help in interp

- Protein Ontology (PRO) that organizes proteins and PTM proteoforms (observed protein forms derived from a single gene, including isoforms and combinations of PTMs), enabling their representation, annotation and comparison within and across species
