[Nicholas Henkel](/authors/nick), an M.D./Ph.D. student in the Cognitive Disorders Research Laboratory (CDRL), was one of this year's recipients of The University of Toledo Graduate Research Award. This award from the UToledo Graduate Student Association (GSA) will provide financial support toward their research projects.

Ten graduate students, as selected by the Graduate Council, recently received the Graduate Research Award for 2022 in conjunction with The University of Toledo College of Graduate Studies.

“This was another competitive year and we received a number of applications that made it very difficult to pick and choose,” said [Ali Imami](/authors/ali), president of the Graduate Students Association. “I would like to thank the members of the Graduate Council Student Affairs Committee and the College of Graduate Studies, who have worked tirelessly to systematically catalog, analyze, rate and rank these applications and then decided on the final recipients.”
