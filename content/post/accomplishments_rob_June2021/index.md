The University of Toledo recognized faculty members who secured external support for their research programs over the 2018-20 period with the 2021 Awards for Grantsmanship.

“In many disciplines, particularly those based on laboratory research, financial demands for personnel support such as students, equipment, supplies and travel far exceed what the University can provide, so external grant support is necessary to support a faculty member’s research,” said Dr. Frank Calzonetti, vice president for research.

[Dr. Robert McCullumsmith](/authors/rob) was among the faculty members who were recognized for 2021 Awards for Grantsmanship during a May ceremony.
