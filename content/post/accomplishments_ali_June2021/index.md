Congratulations to recent master's graduate [Ali Sajid Imami](/authors/ali). The College of Graduate Studies has awarded Ali the prestigious University Fellowship for the 2021-2022 academic school year.

The University Fellowship is the highest award granted to an incoming graduate student by the College of Graduate Studies and is extended only to doctoral students of exceptional ability and promise. In April, Ali defended his thesis for his Master of Science in Biomedical Science Bioinformatics, Proteomics & Genomics. We look forward to hearing great things from Ali in the years to come.
