      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/public_resources/dkkb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (the “DKK”) is being developed as a component of the Kinase Data and Resource Generating Center (DRGC) - one of 3 DRGCs supported as part of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Common Fund effort. The goal of the IDG program is to improve our understanding of the properties and functions of proteins that are currently unannotated within the three most commonly drug-targeted protein families: G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, and protein kinases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the DKK is to generate, systematize and disseminate knowledge about dark kinases, biological networks in which they function and connections to cellular phenotypes and human disease. This is being done by (i) establishing a knowledgebase covering the approximately 160 poorly understood “dark kinases”, (ii) distilling primary data into functional biochemical and biological information and promoting further research using genetic and chemical tools, which we are also developing and making available, (iii) placing dark kinases within a new and emerging network-level understanding of cell signaling and physiology and (iv) identifying those dark kinases whose mutation or mis-regulation is associated with human disease, making them possible therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drug discovery is a time intensive and economically costly process. A wealth of information regarding small molecule targets, side effects, gene expression profiles, among several other attributes are publicly available throughout currently existing online tools and repositories. By collecting and analyzing the aggregated information from these resources, novel relationships between currently existing small molecules can be discovered. Understanding the underlying molecular and structural similarities between seemingly heterogeneous small molecules can aid in drug repurposing studies, and potentially the discovery of novel drugs. Furthermore, these data can be leveraged for machine learning case studies that may predict novel uses for already existing drugs. Drugmonizome is a web portal for querying sets of known drugs and computing significant biomedical terms that drugs in the set share.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DrugShot&lt;/strong&gt; is a search engine that accepts any search term to return a list of small molecules that are mostly associated with the search terms. It can be used to identify novel associations between small molecules and biological mechanisms and processes. A free text search is redirected to a PubMed search via the NCBI E-utilities API for retrieving publications that match the search terms. The resulting list of publications is cross-referenced with DrugRIF or AutoRIF to convert PMIDs to lists of small molecules. DrugRIF and AutoRIF enlist associations between publications and small molecules. DrugShot returns the list of small molecules ranked by their frequency of mentions within the publications returned by the search terms. In addition, the returned small molecules from the initial query are supplanted with additional small molecules based on literature co-mentions and L1000 signature similarity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;iLINCS (Integrative LINCS) is an integrative web platform for analysis of LINCS data and signatures. The portal provides biologists-friendly user interfaces for analyzing transcriptomics and proteomics LINCS datasets. The portal integrates R analytical engine via several R tools for web-computing (rserve, opencpu, Shiny, rgl) and DCIC developed web tools and applications (FTreeView, Enrichr) into a coherent web platform for LINCS data analysis. Users can follow several workflows which allow them to identify differentially expressed genes, proteins and phosphoproteins in LINCS datasets and use them in analysis of other LINCS and non-LINCS dataset (eg TCGA and GEO transcriptomic datasets), and in the analysis of LINCS L1000 signatures. In this way, the platform facilitates integrative analysis of LINCS data and signatures. The mechanistic interpretation of LINCS transcriptomic and proteomics signatures is facilitated by the enrichment analysis via Enrichr and DAVID, and by pathways analysis using the R implementation of the SPIA algorithm. The portal can be accessed freely and does not require user registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are able to compare a &amp;ldquo;disease transcriptional signature&amp;rdquo;, a gene expression profile, to a library of &amp;ldquo;drug activity transcriptional signatures&amp;rdquo; to generate a Connectivity Map based on Connectivity score. Positive correlation between drug perturbations and disease gene expression profiles suggest common gene expression changes, while negative correlation is suggestive of drug perturbation ability to &amp;ldquo;reverse&amp;rdquo; the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portal also provides tools to analyze list of differentially expressed genes in other LINCS and non-LINCS datasets (i.e. TCGA, GEO, etc.) with an option to find concordant LINCS and non-LINCS gene expression signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRING&lt;/strong&gt; is a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations; they stem from computational prediction, from knowledge transfer between organisms, and from interactions aggregated from other (primary) databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Sources
Interactions in STRING are derived from five main sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genomic Context Predictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-throughput Lab Experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Conserved) Co-Expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated Textmining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous Knowledge in Databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coverage:&lt;br&gt;
The STRING database currently covers &lt;em&gt;24,584,628&lt;/em&gt; proteins from &lt;em&gt;5090&lt;/em&gt; organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Human Protein Atlas&lt;/strong&gt; is a Swedish-based program initiated in 2003 with the aim to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues, and organs using an integration of various omics technologies, including antibody-based imaging, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, transcriptomics, and systems biology. All the data in the knowledge resource is open access to allow scientists both in academia and industry to freely access the data for exploration of the human proteome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Human Protein Atlas consists of ten separate sections, each focusing on a particular aspect of the genome-wide analysis of the human proteins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tissue section, showing the distribution of the proteins across all major tissues and organs in the human body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Brain section, exploring the distribution of proteins in various regions of the mammalian brain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Single Cell Type section, showing expression of protein-coding genes in single human cell types based on scRNA-seq&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tissue Cell Type section, showing expression of protein-coding genes in human cell types based on bulk RNAseq data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Pathology section, showing the impact of protein levels for the survival of patients with cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Immune Cell section, showing expression of protein-coding genes in immune cell types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Blood Protein section, describing proteins detected in blood and proteins secreted by human tissues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Subcellular section, showing the subcellular localization of proteins in single cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cell Line section, showing expression of protein-coding genes in human cell lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Metabolic section, exploring expression of protein-coding genes in the context of the human metabolic network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIN-X&lt;/strong&gt; is an interactive visualization tool for discovering interesting associations between diseases and potential drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used natural language processing to identify disease and protein mentions in the text of PubMed abstracts. Using this data, two metrics are derived: novelty and importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novelty measures the relative scarcity of specific publications about a given concept (such as a target or a disease), while importance measures the relative strength of the association between two concepts. This web tool enables users to explore the relationships between the novelty of potential drug targets and their importance to diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Universal Protein Resource (&lt;strong&gt;UniProt&lt;/strong&gt;) is a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data. The UniProt databases are the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef), and the UniProt Archive (UniParc). The UniProt consortium and host institutions EMBL-EBI, SIB and PIR are committed to the long-term preservation of the UniProt databases.&lt;/p&gt;
