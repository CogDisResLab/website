All the data in the knowledge resource is open access to allow scientists both in academia and industry to freely access the data for exploration of the human proteome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Human Protein Atlas consists of ten separate sections, each focusing on a particular aspect of the genome-wide analysis of the human proteins:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Tissue section, showing the distribution of the proteins across all major tissues and organs in the human body&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Brain section, exploring the distribution of proteins in various regions of the mammalian brain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Single Cell Type section, showing expression of protein-coding genes in single human cell types based on scRNA-seq&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Tissue Cell Type section, showing expression of protein-coding genes in human cell types based on bulk RNAseq data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Pathology section, showing the impact of protein levels for the survival of patients with cancer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Immune Cell section, showing expression of protein-coding genes in immune cell types&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Blood Protein section, describing proteins detected in blood and proteins secreted by human tissues&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Subcellular section, showing the subcellular localization of proteins in single cells&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Cell Line section, showing expression of protein-coding genes in human cell lines&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Metabolic section, exploring expression of protein-coding genes in the context of the human metabolic network&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
