&lt;p>Ten graduate students, as selected by the Graduate Council, recently received the Graduate Research Award for 2022 in conjunction with The University of Toledo College of Graduate Studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“This was another competitive year and we received a number of applications that made it very difficult to pick and choose,” said &lt;a href="website/authors/ali/">Ali Imami&lt;/a>, president of the Graduate Students Association. “I would like to thank the members of the Graduate Council Student Affairs Committee and the College of Graduate Studies, who have worked tirelessly to systematically catalog, analyze, rate and rank these applications and then decided on the final recipients.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Drs. Justin Creeden, Khaled Alganem, Ali Imami, and Robert Smith recently published an article in Hepatology (Impact Factor 17.4) with Dr. Terry Hinds and collaborators at the University of Kentucky.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This paper combines bioinformatic studies with basic science laboratory validation studies to generate the first kinome atlas for hepatic fibrosis. In this piece, we utilize human cirrhosis samples and three murine models of fibrosis to measure concordance between human and rodent hepatic kinome signaling. We also identify protein tyrosine kinases or serine/threonine kinases with altered levels of kinase activity in the fibrotic pathways of both species.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="website/authors/rob/">Dr. Robert McCullumsmith&lt;/a>, Chair of the Department of Neurosciences, and Ph.D. candidate &lt;a href="website/authors/khaled/">Khaled Alganem&lt;/a> (pictured) recently published an article in Molecular Psychiatry (Impact Factor 12.4) with collaborators at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The paper explores the disrupted mTOR signaling in schizophrenia and studied the expression and activity of downstream effector proteins of mTOR complexes. The paper also demonstrates key differences in kinase signaling networks between schizophrenia and comparison subjects for both males and females using kinome peptide arrays. The role of mTOR kinase activity is further investigated by inhibiting it with rapamycin in postmortem tissue and comparing the impact of mTOR inhibition in schizophrenia and comparison subjects. It was found that schizophrenia subjects are globally more sensitive to rapamycin treatment and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contributes to this differential kinase activity. Together, The findings provide new insights into the role of mTOR as a master regulator of kinase activity in schizophrenia and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The article was recently featured in the research highlights of Nature Communications Biology.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Congratulations to &lt;a href="website/authors/sinead/">Dr. Sinead O’Donovan&lt;/a>, assistant professor in the Department of Neurosciences, who was selected to serve as an early career reviewer on the Pathophysiological Basis of Mental Disorders (PBMD) and Addictions Study Section at the National Institute of Mental Health. This opportunity will provide her with an insider’s view of how grant applications are evaluated, allowing her to improve her grant writing skills and develop research-evaluation and critique-writing skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Early Career Review Program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) aims to help early career scientists become more competitive as grant applicants through first-hand experience with peer review and to enrich and diversify the Center for Scientific Review’s pool of trained reviewers. Early career reviewers work side-by-side with some of the most accomplished researchers in their field to help NIH identify the most promising grant applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2021 Awards for Grantsmanship Announced at The University of Toledo</title><link>website/post/accomplishments_rob_june2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>website/post/accomplishments_rob_june2021/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The University of Toledo recognized faculty members who secured external support for their research programs over the 2018-20 period with the 2021 Awards for Grantsmanship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“In many disciplines, particularly those based on laboratory research, financial demands for personnel support such as students, equipment, supplies and travel far exceed what the University can provide, so external grant support is necessary to support a faculty member’s research,” said Dr. Frank Calzonetti, vice president for research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="website/authors/rob/">Dr. Robert McCullumsmith&lt;/a> was among the faculty members who were recognized for 2021 Awards for Grantsmanship during a May ceremony.&lt;/p>
