&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/ali&#34;&gt;Ali Sajid Imami&lt;/a&gt;, a Ph.D. student working in the Department of Neurosciences Cognitive Disorders Research Lab under Dr. Robert McCullumsmith, who was recently awarded a prestigious James P. Taylor Foundation for Open Science Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ali was one of only ten outstanding graduate students in genomics and data sciences to receive this honor. The scholarship covers the full conference registration for the 2021 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory conference on Genome Informatics being held in November. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is a leading international center for research and education and facilitates advanced technical science courses, with organizers, instructors and participants from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s conference will cover a wide range of Informatics topics including Microbial and Metagenomics, Sequencing Algorithms, Variant Discovery and Genome Assembly, Evolution, Complex Traits and Phylogenetics, Functional Genomics, Single Cell Genomics and Epigenetics and Genome Structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/rob&#34;&gt;Dr. Robert McCullumsmith&lt;/a&gt;, Chair of the Department of Neurosciences, and Ph.D. candidate &lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/khaled&#34;&gt;Khaled Alganem&lt;/a&gt; (pictured) recently published an article in Molecular Psychiatry (Impact Factor 12.4) with collaborators at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper explores the disrupted mTOR signaling in schizophrenia and studied the expression and activity of downstream effector proteins of mTOR complexes. The paper also demonstrates key differences in kinase signaling networks between schizophrenia and comparison subjects for both males and females using kinome peptide arrays. The role of mTOR kinase activity is further investigated by inhibiting it with rapamycin in postmortem tissue and comparing the impact of mTOR inhibition in schizophrenia and comparison subjects. It was found that schizophrenia subjects are globally more sensitive to rapamycin treatment and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contributes to this differential kinase activity. Together, The findings provide new insights into the role of mTOR as a master regulator of kinase activity in schizophrenia and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article was recently featured in the research highlights of Nature Communications Biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/sinead&#34;&gt;Dr. Sinead O’Donovan&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor in the Department of Neurosciences, who was selected to serve as an early career reviewer on the Pathophysiological Basis of Mental Disorders (PBMD) and Addictions Study Section at the National Institute of Mental Health. This opportunity will provide her with an insider’s view of how grant applications are evaluated, allowing her to improve her grant writing skills and develop research-evaluation and critique-writing skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Early Career Review Program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) aims to help early career scientists become more competitive as grant applicants through first-hand experience with peer review and to enrich and diversify the Center for Scientific Review’s pool of trained reviewers. Early career reviewers work side-by-side with some of the most accomplished researchers in their field to help NIH identify the most promising grant applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2021 Awards for Grantsmanship Announced at The University of Toledo</title>
      <link>/post/accomplishments_rob_june2021/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The University of Toledo recognized faculty members who secured external support for their research programs over the 2018-20 period with the 2021 Awards for Grantsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In many disciplines, particularly those based on laboratory research, financial demands for personnel support such as students, equipment, supplies and travel far exceed what the University can provide, so external grant support is necessary to support a faculty member’s research,” said Dr. Frank Calzonetti, vice president for research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/rob&#34;&gt;Dr. Robert McCullumsmith&lt;/a&gt; was among the faculty members who were recognized for 2021 Awards for Grantsmanship during a May ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M.D./Ph.D. student &lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/justin&#34;&gt;Justin Creeden&lt;/a&gt; wrote a column in the Toledo Blade about using technology to aid in researching cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I combine traditional laboratory research methods that use Petri dishes, test tubes, and microscopes with computational biology techniques that use mathematical modeling and simulations to answer important research questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/justin&#34;&gt;Justin Creeden&lt;/a&gt; is doing his doctoral research in the laboratory of Dr. Robert McCullumsmith, in the Department of Neurosciences.&lt;/p&gt;
